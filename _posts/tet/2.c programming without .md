# c programming without libraries

Making a C library isn’t far different than writing a standard C application. The primary difference is that you’re supplying just functions or a set of functions that accomplish a specific task. Perhaps the library you’re writing provides the means to accomplish a specific task or control some kind of hardware in a fashion that is consistent and easy for users to get a grip on than if they did it from scratch themselves. A library of this caliber is often referred to as an API or Application Programming Interface. Semantics and word definitions aside, let me provide a small example.

You want to write a library that allows a C programmer to easily create a Vector, that is an array that automatically expands when its max capacity is reached. This is quite a useful data structure. So you set out to create a minimal vector library. You first define the interface in a header along with the implementation like so:

NOTE: Found this code in my old programming directories, have no clue when I wrote it or if I wrote it… Maybe it was a friends or something, but it seemed fit to answer the question at hand so I am using it…
```c
// vector.h - Define interface for a simple vector data structure           
// library for use in C programs. 
 
#define VECTOR_INITIAL_CAPACITY 100 
 
/* Vector structure */ 
typedef struct vector Vector; 
struct vector { 
        int size;               // Current slots used 
        int capacity;   // total slots available 
        int *data;              // array of integers we are storing 
}; 
 
/*  Initialize integer vector */ 
void vector_init(Vector *vector); 
/* Append value at the end of vector */ 
void vector_append(Vector *vector, int value); 
/* Get value at specified index */ 
int vector_get(Vector *vector, int index); 
/*  Set vector to specific valye */ 
void vector_set(Vector *vector, int index, int value); 
/*  Double vector size if needed (grow our array) */ 
void vector_grow_if_full(Vector *vector); 
/* Free vector, and clean up */ 
void vector_free(Vector *vector); 
```
 
--- end of vector.h  

--- vector.c implementation 

```c
 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include "vector.h" 
 
void vector_init(Vector *vector) 
{ 
        /*  Set initial size and capacity */ 
        vector->size = 0; 
        vector->capacity = VECTOR_INITIAL_CAPACITY; 
 
        /*  Allocate memory for data to point to */ 
        vector->data = malloc(sizeof(int) * vector->capacity); 
} 
 
void vector_append(Vector *vector, int value) 
{ 
        /*  Make room for new data if needed */ 
        vector_grow_if_full(vector); 
 
        /*  append value and increment size of vector */ 
        vector->data[vector->size++] = value; 
} 
 
int vector_get(Vector *vector, int index) 
{ 
        if (index >= vector->size || index < 0) { 
                fprintf(stderr, "[!] FATAL: Index %d out of bounds for vector size %d\n", index, vector->size); 
                exit(1); 
        } 
 
        return vector->data[index]; 
} 
 
void vector_set(Vector *vector, int index, int value) 
{ 
        /*  Zero fill vector up until index */ 
        while(index >= vector->size) { 
                vector_append(vector, 0); 
 
        } 
 
        /* Set value at location specified by index */ 
        vector->data[index] = value; 
} 
 
void vector_grow_if_full(Vector *vector) 
{ 
        /*  Double vector size if we get full */ 
        if(vector->size >= vector->capacity) { 
                vector->capacity *= 2; 
                vector->data  = realloc(vector->data, sizeof(int) * vector->capacity); 
        } 
} 
 
void vector_free(Vector *vector) 
{ 
        free(vector->data); 
} 
```
--- end of vector.c 

```c 
=== IMPORTANT === 
// Cool! now we have code that implements vector like functionality.  
// Seems like just the kind of thing that could make for a useful 
// library. 
=== IMPORTANT === 
```

--- example using vector code.... 

```c 
// Here we can test the vector data structure code in a little toy 
// program. 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
 
#include "vector.h" 
int main(void) 
{ 
	Vector vec; 
	vector_init(&vec); 
	 
	for (int i = 200; i > -50; i++) { 
		vector_append(&vec, i); 
	} 
 
	vector_set(&vec, 4421, 43421); 
	printf("Here is the value at index 0: %d\n", vector_get(&vec, 0)); 
 
	vector_free(&vec); 
	return 0; 
} 

```
Sorry all the code files were bundles up in one code block the formatting buttons were being weird! Anyway all it shows is a little vector data structure implementation someone might want to turn into a library for usage in other programs of theirs or their friends. So how do we compile it to be a library? Assuming we are on a linux machine it is very simple. Linux refers libraries it loads dynamically which is how most modern libraries choose to operate as a shared object (windows calls them a DLL) the suffix you will often see is “.so” such as libsomething.so.

Assuming we have our code like that shown above simply compile it like so:
```sh
$ gcc -c -Wall -fPIC vector.c 
$ gcc -shared -o libvector.so vector.o 
```
And tada! you now have created a C library that can be dynamically linked into any C program via adding the correct flag when compiling your software. In this case you would add -lvector towards the end of your compilation line.

Not so difficult. Keep in mind we created a dynamic library which is loaded when the program executes. You can also create a static library by a different method but still trivial. I will leave that as an exercise to try on your own and learn about.

Hope this helped. It is late and I am sure there are a few mistakes..

Catching Zzzz..

it depends on what you want to do.

If you don't want to do anything:
```c
int main(){ 
 return 0; 
} 
```
This will work. (It's a perfect C code)

If you want to take input and print output you can always use the _asm block in your code and skip the libraries. (Write everything in Assembly)

Now we will make our own getch() using assembly in C++
the code you can use is:
```c
char getch(void) 
{ 
	char x; 
	asm{ 
       		MOV ah,0; 
            INT 0x16; 
            MOV x,AL; 
       } 
   return 0; 
} 
 
void main() 
{ 
  char x=getch(); 
} 
```
yeh! I have made one But in Turbo C++ and it ran succesfully but since its just getch() output is just a blank screen cannot show you.

here we mix assembly statement in C++.

Similarly you can make a function to display it on screen , I will post that code in a week .

But one bad news bro it is not working in newer C++ versions , I am working on it If I find some way to do it in newer C++ standards , I will update.

Yes ,There is only one option but the most basic one …

Pointer concept is needed and must .

The code is here but it is written in C :

```c
int printf(const char *output, ...);  //Declare the printf() function  
int scanf(const char *input, ...);  //Declare the scanf() function 
  
int main(){  //Main function starts 
  char c[50];  //declare characters of string 
	printf("Enter a string :");  //Enter your desired characters of string  
  scanf("%s ",&c);   
  printf( "Your input :%s",c );  //Your ouput will show your input result 
  return 0; //Exit status of a program 
} 

```
Note : This is C without using any “stdio.h” header files.

Run and compile it in dev C++….Hope it helps .

The code is written for C++ compiler . Here
```c
extern "C" { //extern "C" for C++ compiler 
int printf(const char *output, ...);  //Declare the printf() function inside the extern  
} 
extern "C"{ 
int scanf(const char *input, ...);  //Declare the scanf() function inside the extern 
}  
int main(){ 
  char c[50]; 
	printf("Enter a string :"); 
  scanf("%s",&c); 
  printf( "Your input :%s",c ); 
  return 0;//Exit status  
} 

```
Note : This is for C++ compiler , meaning if you save file in cpp then you have this code .

Run and compile it in Dev C++ … Hope helps a lot.
